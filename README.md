Deep learning model for loan default prediction

*Description*

• Your department seeks to use deep learning on its extensive loan data to predict who will default (“loan_is_bad”) in the hopes of building an automated solution to loan applications.
• You should do some basic feature selection and transformation (i.e. making all values numeric). This may include converting variables to binary or using one-hot encoding techniques (etc). However, you will not need to perform the same level of feature engineering you might with a classical approach.

*Tasks*

Use all valid observations from the loan data (e.g. remove N/A’s etc)
• Perform basic feature engineering to ensure data is in a numerical input and any noise variables are removed
• Build a deep learning model, with an appropriate loss function, to predict which customers will default. Use fewer iterations than we did in our first examples
• Validate the results using test data and appropriate metrics.
• Write a report describing what you did and what your recommendations are for your company based on your findings.
